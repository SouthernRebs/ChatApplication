Chat Application

For chat application (Messy) we will be using a two table method database scheme. 
One for the user profile and one for the message database. UserId and Password will be used to create a profile when first registering 
for the messaging app. The user will be able to choose a nickname to be displayed on the messages.
The user profile will store items such as
-UUID
-USERID
-PASSWORD
-NICKNAME (this will be what shows up on the actual message)
-Profile Picture

The messages database will store items such as
-UUID
-NICKNAME
-SENT (displays whether the message was successfully sent or not)
-TIME (displays what time the message was sent/recieved)
-LOCATION (will display where the user sent the message from)

Some basic features of the app include :
-creating a new user for the app
-logging in to the server after a user is created
-use SendBird messaging API
-send messages back and forth between connected accounts
